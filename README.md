<h3>Immune-inspired string-based negative selection system for Computer Security :ocean:</h3>

<p>Immune systems are present in most living beings, and they protect them from many threats, including some that are unknown to the system. The way this is done is by T cells, that are generated randomly and in large numbers, with the aim that every threat to the living being is detected by at least some of these cells. As T cells are generated randomly, it could occur that one was generated to detected essential parts of the living being as threats. That is why all newborn T cells have to go through a process of Negative Selection. They are shown self proteins which belong to the host, and if a T cell detects any of those proteins, it will be destroyed. Thanks to that process, T cells only detect proteins that are not part of the individual so they can be dealt with.</p>

</p>In this project we are focusing on building a security system based on biological immune systems and applying negative selection.</p>
